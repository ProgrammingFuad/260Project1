GameStore Project written in strictly HTML (with a little help from BootStrap)
This project is the first major project in my Advanced Programming course.  Using purely HTML (along with some Bootstrap) we were
tasked with creating a gamestore. This is my Game Store, the theme is Retro Games and features games from the Atari system.
